            <h2>Our Starts</h2>
            <p>For a college research paper in 2013 our founder Cheryl Barnes discovered what would later be known as "The Gay Gene" through heavy research, Cheryl was able to eradicate the chromosonal pair (AKA "the gay gene") by means of radiation therapy.</p>
            <p>This method of eradication was dangerous, and Cheryl knew she needed more funding if she wanted to continue her research, in 2014 she founded our company TransVita</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>To ensure a better future for generations we have a set of goals prepared to do one after another to have a perfect earth in 100 years</p>

    <p>Eradicating the Gay Gene: Ever since the discovery of the gay gene back in 2013 our team has worked hard and developed a one time vaccine to delete the chromosomal pair from you genome.</p>

    <p>Reversing the Work of Yakub: Our researchers have discovered that all problems of the world lead back to the year 4577 BCE when yakub completed his work, once we eraticate the gay gene we will begin progress on reversing Yakub's work.</p>
